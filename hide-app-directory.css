/*
For *whatever reason*, this single menu option in server settings, conveniently placed where it's
likely you've accidentally clicked on it at least once trying to click on Integrations,
*does not return you to where you were previously when closed*.

It instead closes the entire server settings menu.

Because UX is a completely foreign concept to Discord.

(do note that if you still need to get to this for whatever reason, you can still do so through the right click context menu.)
