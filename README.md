# The Discord trash collector

This is a (relatively opinionated) collection of CSS snippets aimed at making Discord slightly more tolerable by
hiding certain "features".

## How to use

The simplest option is to open the relevant `.css` file from the list in this repository and copy/paste its contents
into the Custom CSS editor of your client mod of choice. *(some may give this feature a different name, such as Quick CSS;
they should all work the same regardless.)*

This is primarly built to support [OpenAsar](https://openasar.dev/), but given that this is just plain CSS, everything
in this repository should work on nearly every client mod, such as Vencord, Better Discord, or even regular browser
extensions like Stylus.
