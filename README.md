# The Discord trash collector

This is a collection of CSS snippets aimed at making Discord slightly more tolerable by removing some trash "features".

Do note that this is entirely built up based on my personal complaints while using Discord; as such, this could be considered
at least slightly opinionated, or even outright completely nonsensical to most average users.

These are all split up into individual CSS files to allow for picking and choosing what you care about; simply
copy the contents of the file, and paste it into the Custom CSS of the client mod of your choice.
