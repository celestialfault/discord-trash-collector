/*
For whatever godforsaken reason, if you specifically unfollow a voice channel, the channel is never
*fully* hidden. Instead, if someone joins a voice channel you don't "follow", then instead Discord shoves
this ridiculous nag at the bottom of the channel list, telling you people are in voice.

Now, get this: I have the voice channel hidden, because I *do not care*, and will *never join the voice channel*.
