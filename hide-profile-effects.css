/*
Profile effects, with only a literal handful handful of exceptions, are nothing more than overly animated,
obnoxious, and just outright obtrusive animations, which completely obscure the profile you're trying
to look at.

Because heaven forbid we actually let you look at someone's profile.

Yes, hovering over the profile card does reduce the opacity, but I don't want to have to do that.
So instead, let's just completely hide them. That fixes the issue pretty well.
